I am a **Tenured Full Professor** in the School of Foreign Languages at Tongji University, where I explore the fascinating intersection of **computational linguistics**, **cognitive computation**, and **artificial intelligence**. My research bridges the gap between human language processing and machine learning, integrating statistical modeling, deep learning, and cognitive-neuroscience experimental methods to understand the deep mechanisms of language understanding and processing in both humans and machines. I have developed a amount of specialized large language models, as well as major databases and corpora, widely used in academia and industry. As global efforts accelerate in ‚ÄúAI + Education", I am committed to applying data-driven approaches to advance language research toward big language science.

## Research Focus

My work sits at the cutting edge of **computational linguistics** and **cognitive AI**, where I develop novel computational methods to understand human language processing and machine intelligence. I'm particularly passionate about:

- **üß† Cognitive Computation & Brain-inspired AI**: Developing computational models that explain how humans process language, using eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI data to understand the neural mechanisms of discourse comprehension
- **ü§ñ Large Language Models & Reasoning**: Evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, fine-tuning transformer-based models, and developing attention-aware computational metrics for multi-modal language processing  
- **üí≠ Affective Computing**: Understanding emotion and sentiment in human language through computational approaches
- **üìä Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Applying sophisticated statistical methods including Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM), Bayesian modeling, and time-series analysis to linguistic phenomena
