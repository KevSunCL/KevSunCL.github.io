    """
    Compute attention-aware semantic relevance scores
    that correlate with human reading behavior
    """
    inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs, output_attentions=True)
    
    # Extract and process attention weights
    attention_weights = outputs.attentions
